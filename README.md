# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Google-Play-Store-Apps

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Google Play Store dataset. The goal is to derive actionable insights about app trends, user behavior, and market dynamics by analyzing app categories, ratings, installs, and more.

---

##  Objective

The main objectives of this analysis are:

- To clean and preprocess the dataset for consistency and accuracy.
- To understand the distribution of app categories and their popularity.
- To examine the relationships between installs, reviews, and user ratings.
- To compare performance metrics between free and paid apps.
- To identify outliers and trends over time using statistical and visual methods.

##  Dataset Source

- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** [Google Play Store Apps Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
- The dataset contains metadata for over 10,000 apps available on the Google Play Store, including features like rating, reviews, installs, type (Free/Paid), and more.

---

##  Key Insights

- **Most apps** on the Play Store are free, reinforcing the freemium model.
- **Games, Tools, and Communication apps** dominate in terms of both count and installs.
- **Paid apps** tend to have slightly higher average ratings than free ones.
- The distribution of installs is **highly skewed**, with a few apps capturing a large portion of total downloads.
- A **positive correlation** exists between reviews and ratings, although some top-reviewed apps also show lower ratings.
- **Temporal analysis** reveals subtle trends in user satisfaction over time, possibly influenced by app updates or platform changes.

##  Visualizations

This project includes several insightful visualizations:

- Bar charts showing app distribution across categories.
- Box plots and scatter plots analyzing installs vs. rating and reviews.
- Line plot tracking average rating trends over time.
- Heatmaps and t-tests for statistical validation of assumptions.
